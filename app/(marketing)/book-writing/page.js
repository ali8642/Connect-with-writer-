const FAQS = [
  { q: "What does a book writing service include?", a: "A full book writing service typically includes a discovery consultation, ghostwriting or co-writing of the full manuscript, professional editing and proofreading, cover design and interior formatting, and guidance through self-publishing or traditional submission. At Connect with Writer, every package includes unlimited revisions and direct access to your writer throughout the process." },
  { q: "How much does it cost to hire a ghostwriter?", a: "Ghostwriting costs vary based on book length, research depth, and genre, typically ranging from a few thousand dollars for a short nonfiction book to tens of thousands for a fully researched memoir or novel. We provide a custom quote after a free consultation." },
  { q: "How long does it take to write a book?", a: "Most full-length books take three to six months to write from outline to final draft, depending on length, genre, and how much research is required." },
  { q: "Who owns the rights to my book once it's written?", a: "You retain 100% ownership of your manuscript, copyright, and royalties once it's written. Our writers work under a confidentiality and ownership-transfer agreement." },
  { q: "What's the difference between ghostwriting and collaborative writing?", a: "Ghostwriting means a professional writer drafts the entire manuscript with your name as sole author. Collaborative writing involves more back-and-forth drafting with you." },
  { q: "Do you help with publishing and marketing after the book is written?", a: "Yes. Once your manuscript is finished and edited, we help with cover design, interior formatting, and a launch plan to help your book reach readers." },
  { q: "Is my information and manuscript kept confidential?", a: "Yes. Every project starts with a confidentiality agreement, and our writers and editors are bound by strict non-disclosure terms." },
  { q: "What genres or types of books do you write?", a: "We write across both fiction and nonfiction, including memoirs, self-help, business, health and wellness, thrillers, mystery, and romance." },
